# Algorithms

## General

* [What's the deal with algorithms?](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/02/what_is_an_algorithm_an_explainer.html)  (2016, Slate)
* [Your algorithms cheat sheet](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/02/algorithms_101_a_cheat_sheet_to_the_terminology_the_ethical_debates_and.html) (2016, Slate)
* [The Nim Game](http://www.archimedes-lab.org/game_nim/nim.html#) - The computer always beats humans... because it uses an algorithm. 
* Human Resource Machine
* [How to teach yourself about algorithms](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/02/how_to_teach_yourself_about_algorithms.html) (2016, Slate)
* [Asking the right questions about AI](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/asking-the-right-questions-about-ai-7ed2d9820c48) - really nice accessible explainer for AI, starting with intuition about what it is, what it's good/bad for, and how it intersects with classes of ethical issues (e.g., bias, whether you're optimizing for the right criterion, opacity)

## Bias

* [Lawmakers can't ignore facial recognition bias anymore](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-facial-recognition-congress-bias-law-enforcement/?mbid=social_twitter_onsiteshare) - references recent (~July 2018) ACLU audit of Amazon's facial recognition system that's being marketed to law enforcement (among others). Connects with larger issues of how the errors it makes are inequitably distributed across race (40% of errors were for people of color). Also includes references to arguments about whether human checks are sufficient (people can over-rely on algorithms, may not know to change the default settings, etc.).
